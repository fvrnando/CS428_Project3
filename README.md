# CS428_Project2
TAs & PROFESSOR PLEASE READ!!!!

We accidentally uploaded an update to the project even though we have our final commit posted 
from the due date on October 15. You can see in the Commit History that the final commit
is still avaliable and that should be the final project files. We didn't intend to update the project,
rather we intended to push a copy to it into a different repository but it ended up messing up
the final commit on the submission.
